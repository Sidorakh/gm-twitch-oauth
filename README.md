# gm-twitch-oauth

Apologies for the emoji, was rapidly prototying this on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/about)

A quick and dirty oauth system for Twitch with an intended GMS2 client, standalone to my [other one](https://github.com/sidorakh/twitter-x-gm) for literally no reason. [The client code can be found here](https://mega.nz/file/kCpAWKQR#YfchpoQvFi_jAM64XC63W_wkEw2ywDqeaW2adWzf30w)
